# Tao HTML Boilerplate
This HTML Boilerplate is meant to serve as a basis for all smaller sites within the TAO universe. It shares its basic HTML as well as the CSS with the main product. The CSS is pulled from the TAO core every night.

If you are creating variations of this site - for instance by adding a sidebar - please commit them to a new menaingfully named branch.
